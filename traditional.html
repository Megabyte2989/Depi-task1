<h1>Unveiling Alexandria's Traditional Flavors: </h1>
<p>Alexandria, the vibrant Egyptian port city, boasts a rich history and a cuisine just as captivating. Unlike Upper Egypt, Alexandrian cuisine is influenced by its coastal location and the diverse communities that have called it home.  Let's embark on a delicious adventure, exploring the unique flavors and dishes that define Alexandria's culinary heritage</p>

<h2>Fresh from the Sea:</h2>
<p>Given its proximity to the Mediterranean Sea, seafood takes center stage in Alexandrian cuisine.  Samak mashwy (grilled whole fish) is a quintessential dish, simply seasoned and cooked to perfection, allowing the natural flavors to shine.  For a bolder taste, try samak singari, a local favorite featuring fish cooked in a tomato sauce infused with cilantro, cumin, and chili.  
Gambari mashwy (grilled prawns) is another must-try, offering a delightful combination of sweet and savory.</p>

<h2>A Touch of France:</h2>
<p>Alexandria's historical ties with Europe are evident in its Alexandrian cheese fondue. This creamy delight, unlike its Swiss counterpart, is typically enjoyed with pita bread or vegetables, offering a delightful appetizer or light meal</p>
<h2>Foul with a Twist:</h2>
<p>Foul medames, the national Egyptian dish of mashed fava beans, gets a unique twist in Alexandria.  Foul Eskandarani incorporates bell peppers and tomatoes, adding a vibrant touch to this classic breakfast dish</p>
<h2>Liver on the Rise:</h2>
<p>Kebda Eskandarani (Alexandrian liver) is a local favorite.  This dish features fried beef liver seasoned with a symphony of spices like cumin, garlic, cardamom, and chili.  It's typically served in sandwiches with tahini dip, on rice, or simply with pita bread on the side.</p>
